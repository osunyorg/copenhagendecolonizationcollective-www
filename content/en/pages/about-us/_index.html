    <p>Mission Statement  <br>   <br>We are an interdisciplinary and intercultural initiative, based in Copenhagen, critically engaged with theories and practices of decolonization. Our work focuses on creating a space for reflection, discussion and learning about the colonial structures that shape our institutions, knowledge systems, and everyday lives. Through awareness-raising and resource-sharing, we seek to challenge dominant narratives. We are still in the middle of our learning process—we do not claim expertise but approach this work with curiosity, and a commitment to growth. With critical allyship at the core of our work, the collective is open to scholars, students, activists, and practitioners in any field of knowledge, who want to create a space where we can collectively imagine a decolonial future.</p>  <p> Our Story  <br>   <br>As students and young professionals, we aspire to change the world with our curiosity. However, the current structures of science and practice in the Global Minority World build upon colonial legacies and uphold existing power imbalances and inequalities. ​​​As students, we have become more and more angry with how the fields we practice are infiltrated by power abuse, neocolonial pressures and performative actions. Decolonisation has become a buzzword; through  elite capture,  the word has become co-opted to something performative and trendy, instead of something that creates radical change in the hegemonic power hierarchies we currently participate in. ​ Why does academia continue to operate within these harmful frameworks? Why have disciplines resisted the changes that will bring about equity? ​​​We as new generation of students and young professionals want to do better. We want to learn how to construct truly equitable partnerships and build decolonial futures. We want to see this mirrored into our future curricula, employment opportunities and political systems. ​This platform is also a call for any student or professional  to become or stay active.You have the right to protest your own learnings, your own institutions and your own political systems.  In solidarity,  The Copenhagen Decolonization Collective</p>  <p> The team  </p>
