    <p>About Us  <br>   <br>We are an interdisciplinary and intercultural initiative, based in Copenhagen, critically engaged with theories and practices of decolonization. Our work focuses on creating a space for reflection, discussion and learning about the colonial structures that shape our institutions, knowledge systems, and everyday lives. Through awareness-raising and resource-sharing, we seek to challenge dominant narratives.  We are still in the middle of our learning process-we do not claim expertise but approach this work with curiosity, and a commitment to growth. With critical allyship at the core of our work, the collective is open to scholars, students, activists, and practitioners in any field of knowledge, who want to create a space where we can collectively imagine a decolonial future.  </p>
