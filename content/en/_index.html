Decolonisation is the process of undoing the colonialism that has dominated governments, economies, and ideologies for the past centuries. We cannot speak of decolonization, without mentioning inequality and power imbalances. Even though most former colonies have been liberated, we still see a global domination of the Global North in access to resources, labour and money. This inequality, produced by colonialism, is maintained by the hegemonic power imbalance between the  Global Minority World  (Global North) and  Global Majority World  (Global South). Colonialism is a system in which everything produced in the Global Minority World, -ideas, products, knowledge- is valued "higher", and "more powerful", while the Global Majority World remains belittled and devalued. One of the goals of decolonization aims to shift this narrative, and disrupt this power imbalance. ​ Want to read more? We invite you to visit  this page.  New to our page?   We are a collective based in Copenhagen, who aspire to change the dominant narratives in science and practice within the Global Minority World. Besides that, we aim to create a space of awareness-raising and knowledge-sharing. Please note that we are still students and do not claim expertise. Instead, we want to build a community, where we can learn from each other (and unlearn our colonial biases). ​If you want to read more about us, please visit  this page. </p>
